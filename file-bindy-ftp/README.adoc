= File consumer with Bindy & FTP: A Camel Quarkus example
:cq-example-description: An example that shows how to consume CSV files, marshal & unmarshal the data and send it onwards via FTP

{cq-description}

TIP: Check the https://camel.apache.org/camel-quarkus/latest/first-steps.html[Camel Quarkus User guide] for prerequisites
and other general information.


== Prerequisites

The example application requires a running FTP server. For simplicity, you can start one with Docker.

[source,shell]
----
docker run -ti --rm -p 2222:2222 \
    -e PASSWORD_ACCESS=true \
    -e USER_NAME=ftpuser \
    -e USER_PASSWORD=ftppassword \
    -e DOCKER_MODS=linuxserver/mods:openssh-server-openssh-client \
    linuxserver/openssh-server
----

If you prefer to use a different server, then the properties prefixed with `ftp.` in `src/main/resources/application.properties` can be adjusted for this purpose.

== Start in Development mode

Ensure the aforementioned FTP server is running and do the following to run the application in development mode.

[source,shell]
----
$ mvn clean compile quarkus:dev
----

The above command compiles the project, starts the application and lets the Quarkus tooling watch for changes in your
workspace. Any modifications in your project will automatically take effect in the running application.

TIP: Please refer to the Development mode section of
https://camel.apache.org/camel-quarkus/latest/first-steps.html#_development_mode[Camel Quarkus User guide] for more details.

You should start to see some log messages appearing on the console.

Every 10 seconds the timer component triggers the generation of some random 'books' data and creates a CSV file in a temporary directory with 100 entries.

[source,shell]
----
[route1] (Camel (camel-1) thread #3 - timer://generateBooks) Generating randomized books CSV data
----

Next the CSV file is read by a file consumer and Bindy is used to marshal the individual data rows into `Book` objects.

[source,shell]
----
[route2] (Camel (camel-1) thread #1 - file:///tmp/books) Reading books CSV data from 89A0EE24CB03A69-0000000000000000
----

Next the collection of `Book` objects is split into individual items and is aggregated based on the `genre` property.

[source,shell]
----
[route3] (Camel (camel-1) thread #0 - AggregateTimeoutChecker) Processed 34 books for genre 'Action'
[route3] (Camel (camel-1) thread #0 - AggregateTimeoutChecker) Processed 31 books for genre 'Crime'
[route3] (Camel (camel-1) thread #0 - AggregateTimeoutChecker) Processed 35 books for genre 'Horror'
----

Finally, the aggregated book collections are unmarshalled back to CSV format and uploaded to the test FTP server.

[source,shell]
----
[route4] (Camel (camel-1) thread #2 - seda://processed) Uploaded books-Action-89A0EE24CB03A69-0000000000000069.csv
[route4] (Camel (camel-1) thread #2 - seda://processed) Uploaded books-Crime-89A0EE24CB03A69-0000000000000069.csv
[route4] (Camel (camel-1) thread #2 - seda://processed) Uploaded books-Horror-89A0EE24CB03A69-0000000000000069.csv

=== Package and run the application

Once you are done with developing you may want to package and run the application.

[source,shell]
----
$ mvn clean package -DskipTests
$ java -jar target/*-runner.jar
----

==== Deploying to OpenShift

To deploy the application to OpenShift run the following command.

[source,shell]
----
$ mvn clean package -DskipTests -Dquarkus.kubernetes.deploy=true
----

Check pods are running.

[source,shell]
----
$ oc get pods

NAME                                                     READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
camel-quarkus-examples-file-bindy-ftp-5d48f4d85c-sjl8k   1/1       Running   0          21s
ssh-server-deployment-5c667bccfc-52xfz                   1/1       Running   0          21s
----

Tail the application logs.

[source,shell]
----
$ oc logs -f camel-quarkus-examples-file-bindy-ftp-5d48f4d85c-sjl8k
----

To clean up do.

[source,shell]
----
$ oc delete all -l app.kubernetes.io/name=camel-quarkus-examples-file-bindy-ftp
----

[NOTE]
====
If you need to configure container resource limits & requests, or enable the Quarkus Kubernetes client to trust self signed certificates, you can find these configuration options in `src/main/resources/application.properties`. Simply uncomment them and set your desired values.
====

==== Deploying to OpenShift without Maven

To deploy this application via the standard OpenShift S2I workflow, you must first deploy the required FTP server service.

[source,shell]
----
$ oc apply -f src/main/kubernetes/openshift.yml
----

Check pods are running.

[source,shell]
----
$ kubectl get pods

NAME                                                     READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
ssh-server-deployment-5c667bccfc-52xfz                   1/1       Running   0          21s
